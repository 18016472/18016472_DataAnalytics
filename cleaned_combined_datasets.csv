31. The woman who asked why she wasnt believed about Cosby for 30 years? You didnt have to see what it was like inside herself.,0,12822
30. That is considered unseemly unprofessional personal private. What it needs to be is safe and supported and sometimes witnessed,0,12823
29. Because the really hard part is still mostly kept from public space: the crying and shaking and terror so many have to go through,0,12824
28. Our future needs emotional early learning to be more convenient than Uber and more likely of funding despite obstacles.,0,12825

26. Making those that do harm into cartoon villains helps no one. They generally were unseen themselves and pass it on.,0,12827

22. Its why I have focussed on creating public space in showstalks etc. Because being yourself and seen is transforming.,0,12831
21. IMO that not being able to be seen  seen as yourself is at the heart of every injury identity politics categorizes.,0,12832
20. Its what continues the harm after the fact. Its how isolation occurs. at how self-doubt and why bother? continues.,0,12833

7. Thing a system could do. Those who had been hurt needed at least to be heard. Working through police wasnt doing that.,0,12847
6. I heard many many complaints. It became clear to me from the SHGB and my Speak Out experience that being heard was the most critical,0,12848
5. a way for a culture to tell itself it was righteous when it didnt want to look at the massive problem or focus on problem solving,0,12849
4. The SHGB was somewhat effective but there were many cases hard to deal with. My work there convinced me criminalizing rape was actually,0,12850
3. ...when I was an undergrad. The SHGB existed only bc a Yale Law student has once sued the school for no procedure  Catharine MacKinnon,0,12851
