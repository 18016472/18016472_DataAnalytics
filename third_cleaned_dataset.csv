@jasonrcombs @mrportraitist Depends on the contract. There are no lifelong contracts anymore.,0

@glen_malley Well I am far from lvl9 :D I am lvl3 and 4 mostly.,0
@jasonrcombs @mrportraitist Contract as a freeter? Because you if you are Keiyaku or simple Shain company should pay health insurance,0

37. So if you have read through all this somehow and want me to know youre with me you can just @ me a .     I will appreciate it.,0
36. I once learned from @fraying that when you dont know what to say you can leave a . in the comments (now the feed).,0
35. Unsurprisingly I have a lot more to say about these things but Ill stop in a moment for now.,0
34. is shaped by how its asked and if the person asked believes the asker really wants to know and can really hear them.,0
33. There are multiple POVs happening all the time always. Always. And the answer to How do you feel? Even if its remembered to be asked,0
32. When the media stories focus on the external incident maybe with the famous guy we publicly get a moment and from which POV?,0
31. The woman who asked why she wasnt believed about Cosby for 30 years? You didnt have to see what it was like inside herself.,0
30. That is considered unseemly unprofessional personal private. What it needs to be is safe and supported and sometimes witnessed,0
29. Because the really hard part is still mostly kept from public space: the crying and shaking and terror so many have to go through,0
28. Our future needs emotional early learning to be more convenient than Uber and more likely of funding despite obstacles.,0
27. What is going to help is saying publicly exactly what is going on. Plus a lot of therapy.,0
26. Making those that do harm into cartoon villains helps no one. They generally were unseen themselves and pass it on.,0
25. A failure of imagination that there could be mutually desired action or outcome. A mode of being that exiles trust @jerrymichalski,0
24. Because manipulation is at heart a not-seeing of the person you deal with. A way of trying to get your need met at their expense.,0
23. And why I want to see business re-organize around #WITH relationships (I use the term to help me track my work).,0
22. Its why I have focussed on creating public space in showstalks etc. Because being yourself and seen is transforming.,0
21. IMO that not being able to be seen  seen as yourself is at the heart of every injury identity politics categorizes.,0
20. Its what continues the harm after the fact. Its how isolation occurs. at how self-doubt and why bother? continues.,0
19. Not being able to be heard or seen is IMO the core of the injury. Its what enables rapes assaults and belittlements (is that a word?),0
18. For those of you shocked SHOCKED about Ghomeshi or Cosby or a Yale Law profs comments know that this is the water weve all swum in,0
17. You know its happened if your body keeps the score (Alice Millers phrase). You see it in others and you share.,0
16. The world of sexual harassment and rape has lived in backchannels when its lived at all for eons in a permanent IRC in the ether.,0
15. He tried to become a freshperson counsellor. Because I was friendly w a female College Dean I was able to tell admin who wd hear me.,0
14. I thought I would be safe. I was learning. When I told this story at the Speak Out much later women told me more about him. Serial.,0
13. One reason I went home w the guy beyond being 19 was because he was a Yale Law Student. Then I thought that meant he cd lose something,0
@sandyanne57 Absolutely! Me too. But even that is a looking at work that already is made. @atelierivaan,0
12. Nobody will believe you. That gets at the heart of the problem.,0
11. ...and told me he could rape me and nobody would ever know. I argued like the eventual law student Id become and he replied,0
10. And sadly reminds me of my own experience with a Yale Law student when I was a first year college student. He was on top of me...,0
9. ...today not seem to get the basis of the legal moral+practical point of consent reflects an inability to imagine desired relationships,0
8. Bathroom walls did some time. The Speak Out did so spectacularly. Twitter has helped make that space now. To hear a Yale Law prof,0
7. Thing a system could do. Those who had been hurt needed at least to be heard. Working through police wasnt doing that.,0
6. I heard many many complaints. It became clear to me from the SHGB and my Speak Out experience that being heard was the most critical,0
5. a way for a culture to tell itself it was righteous when it didnt want to look at the massive problem or focus on problem solving,0
4. The SHGB was somewhat effective but there were many cases hard to deal with. My work there convinced me criminalizing rape was actually,0
3. ...when I was an undergrad. The SHGB existed only bc a Yale Law student has once sued the school for no procedure  Catharine MacKinnon,0

@rushkoff I dont remember the sign though I remember Barneys Beanery. But signs about gays and AIDS are an old thing. Governors passing,0
14. You might be uncomfortable. That doesnt make the joke anti-Semitic. This piece is saying some uncomfortable Jewish stuff out loud. Good,0
13. Jews were killed in a supermarket in France RECENTLY. Would you even make your avatar Je Suis Juif? Or are you only ballsy about Dunham,0
12. Its offering to set a straight Jewish male comic up with a Jewish woman. To prove miracles can happen.,0
11. The hard stuff is facing the Left when its anti-Semitic. Its criticizing Israel without worry about being a shonda for the goyim.,0
10. Mobilize against real problems. Remember when you are safe. Find your freedom INSIDE. Keep your sense of humour.,0
9.Jews freaked out by anti-Semitism? Indiana just passed a law to put up signs in stores saying NO GAYS. Please take a note fr fellow queers,0

5. Shes a Jewish humorist. So am I. The best thing about being Jewish is the jokes. Seriously. Its our strength people. Dont lose it.,0
4. Its safe to go after @lenadunham because you dont like her for whatever reason so you think that makes her anti-Semitic?,0
3. I co-host @morningJewshow  and we get some anti-Semitic crap sent to us daily online. I see it in the left plenty BUT,0

Tech industry likes more than one experience of a thing when it reads this as platform growth in a chart. Trouble processing it otherwise.,0

@trevortwining @coworkniagara Wd be great to see it! I learned a lot of what I know abt social space being bullied in NF.Lessons everywhere!,0
14. The people on the outside are the artists of business. They dont have Fast Co profiles.,0
13. these problems as guides to your very first acts. All the isms are ways we dont see everyone create holistically.,0
12. sexism  racism etc are systemic and longtime probs. If you mindfully build social space (ie a decent co) then youll use countering,0
11. To be more specific (Im referring to last nights #d tweets) I was referring to companiesorgs thinking diversity is some extra thing,0

@mathpunk did you recognize them on the street?,0
@mathpunk social drives all human behaviour. Tech is just a way.,0
10. If you want a space to fell welcome YOU have to spend time there. You have to great people and care how they feel. Subjectively feel.,0
9. Tools by themselves dont make space. A six pack in an empty room doesnt make a party.,0
8. And are stunned STUNNED when there are problems with harassment later or people treating each other badly.,0
7. They then expect people in this pasted on space to do their marketing and cheerleading for them.,0
6. People build organizations software whatever and thing 6 months in theyll paste on a community + hire a community mgr to babysit,0
5. If you want to create social space thats inclusive you have to START with the margins. Its not like adding rooms on to a house.,0
@mathpunk yup. My Google talk is talking about this stuff but Im just here making the diversity stuff a bit clearer.,0
4. Its the people on the margins who will have the most information about what makes a space inclusive.,0
3. We have lots of experience with the details of critiquing this ( in recent years anyway) but less making good space.,0
Ok Ill number these 2. all the isms include major amounts of people not being seen  being reduced or dismissed.,0
Problems with lack of diversity and racist or sexist harassment etc are all subsets of failure in social design and social space making.,0
